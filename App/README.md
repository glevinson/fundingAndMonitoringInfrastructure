## Web App for Viewing Project Data

I have created a web app that allows users to view the data associated with projects they have invested in. The frontend was built using the React JavaScript library and the backend with Express.js. A authentication mechanism is included in the backend that determines which project data the user is allowed access to. When a user requests to view their project data, they are prompted to sign a message with a cryptocurrency wallet (such a wallet must be installed). The signature is passed as a parameter to the back-end in a GET request. The signature and contents of the message signed are then passed to the authentication mechanism. The data associated with the project names outputted by the authentication mechanism is returned to the frontend and displayed on the user interface.

## Data Access Authentication Mechanism

I developed the authentication mechanism in JavaScript using the Express.js framework and Ethers library. As investment into a project is represented by ownership of the project’s RFTs or NFT, the authentication mechanism uses these tokens to grant access to the project’s data. The mechanism is passed the user’s signature of a message and the message’s contents as parameters. The mechanism subsequently determines the user’s address. By interacting with the blockchain that the ‘ProjectMarketplace’ contract is deployed on, the mechanism iterates through all the created projects and grants access to a particular project’s data if the user holds at least the data access threshold, specified when the project is created, of corresponding RFTs or the project NFT itself.
