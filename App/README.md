We have built an authentication mechanism in JavaScript by using the Ex- press.js framework and Ethers library. As investment into a project is repre- sented by ownership of the project’s RFTs or NFT, the authentication mecha- nism uses these tokens to grant access to the project’s data. The mechanism is passed the user’s signature of a message and the message’s contents as param-eters. The mechanism subsequently determines the user’s address. By interact- ing with the blockchain that the ‘ProjectMarketplace’ contract is deployed on, the mechanism iterates through all the created projects and grants access to a particular project’s data if the user holds at least the data access threshold, specified when the project is created, of corresponding RFTs or the project NFT itself. We have built a web application that allows users to view the project data authorised to them by the authentication mechanism.
