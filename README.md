# infrastructure-funding-and-monitoring

This repository contains the technical architecture for my MSc Computing thesis at Imperial College London: 'DAOs for Funding & Monitoring Infrastructure in Developing Countries'. I propose a novel financing pathway for building infrastructure in developing countries that is faster and offers greater accountability than existing approaches. My work recieved a distinction (75%) and is under publication.

I designed and developed an ecosystem of Ethereum smart contracts, in Solidity, that enables users to create on-chain fundraises for infrastructure projects using stablecoins. These smart contracts are in the [ProjectMarketplace direcotry](ProjectMarketplace). I also developed a web application, written in JavaScript, that enables investors to monitor their projects using data that project proposers are required to supply. This web app can be found in the [App directory](App). Please view the [final report](final_report.pdf) for more information.

## Publication

The thesis is under publication in the ACM acadmeic journal: ['Distributed Ledger Technology: Research and Practice'](https://dl.acm.org/journal/dlt), where it is co-authored by [Dr Catherine Mulligan](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/c.mulligan), the ‘European Research Area Chair in Blockchain’, and [Professor William Knottenbelt](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/w.knottenbelt), Director of the ‘Centre for Cryptocurrency Research and Engineering’.


## Implemented by a DAO

This architecture is being implemented by a DAO which is under development and who's founders I have worked closely with throughout my thesis. The DAO is financially backed by [Brevan Howard](https://www.brevanhoward.com/) & Imperial College London. However, my architecture is not limited the aforementioned DAO and has been designed so that other DAOs can also straightforwardly implement it.
