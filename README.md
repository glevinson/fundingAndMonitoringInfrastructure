# infrastructure-funding-and-monitoring

This repository contains the technical architecture for my MSc Computing thesis at Imperial College London. This architecture is being implemented by the 'Spring DAO'; a DAO which is under development that aims to provide an alternative pathway for financing, constructing & monitoring infrastructure in developing countries. The Spring DAO is supported by Brevan Howard & Imperial. This technical architecture addresses the financing & monitoring stages of the Spring DAO's project lifecycle. However, this architecture is not limited to the Spring DAO and has been designed flexibly so that other DAOs aiming to finance and monitor funded infrastructure projects can straightforwardly implement it.

Abstract: 

Traditional fundraising routes for financing infrastructure projects in developing countries are typically slow and inefficient. Capital raised must pass through multiple unnecessary layers of bureaucracy, whether that be financial institutions or government officials, before reaching the intended beneficiary. This pathway makes it very difficult to make fast impactful change and enables corruption, resulting in reduced investment to the areas that need infrastructure the most.


In this thesis, we propose an alternative financing pathway. We present a tech- nical architecture that enables the proposal, fundraising and monitoring of infrastructure projects on the Ethereum blockchain. The architecture is intended to be implemented by decentralized autonomous organizations with a focus in financing infrastructure development in the Global South.

Our eco-system of smart contracts allows capital to be raised in a cryptocurrency chosen by the entity that proposes the project. Consequently, capital raised bypasses third party institutions and reaches the desired entities much faster. Investors are granted access to data associated with projects that they have invested in. This data enables investors to monitor a successfully funded project’s progress and, upon completion, maintenance.

Our architecture has been well received by experts in smart contracts, in applying blockchain and in building infrastructure in underdeveloped nations respectively. We also demonstrate that our smart contract gas fees are low considering each transac- tion’s particular use case.
