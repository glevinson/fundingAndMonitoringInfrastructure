# infrastructure-funding-and-monitoring

This repository contains the technical architecture for my MSc Computing thesis at Imperial College London: 'DAOs for Funding & Monitoring Infrastructure in Developing Countries'. The proposed system includes an eco-system of smart contracts, written in Solidity, for Ethereum which providea an alternative pathway for financing, constructing and monitoring infrastructure projects in developing countries. It also includes a web application for viewing data associated with the infrastructure projects that is written in JavaScript. For more information, [here is a link to the original paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Ij9gEIJHgMeb3I2yotvqxlnJzJ_2Fcu/view?usp=sharing).

## Published

The thesis is being re-formatted and submitted for publishing in the ACM acadmeic journal: 'Distributed Ledger Technology: Research and Practice', where it will be co-authored by Dr Catherine Mulligan, the ‘European Research Area Chair in Blockchain’, and Professor William Knottenbelt, Director of the ‘Centre for Cryptocurrency Research and Engineering’.


## Implemented by the 'Spring DAO'

This architecture is being implemented by the 'Spring DAO'; a DAO which is under development and who's founders I have worked closely with throughout my thesis. It is supported by Brevan Howard & Imperial College London. However, my architecture is not limited to the Spring DAO and has been designed so that other DAOs can also straightforwardly implement it.
