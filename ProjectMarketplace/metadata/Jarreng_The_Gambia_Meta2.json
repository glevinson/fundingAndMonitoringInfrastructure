    "name": "Water System: Jarreng, The Gambia",
    "description": 
    "This NFT corresponds to a water system proposed by eWater and being funded on the Spring DAO for the people of Jarreng, The Gambia. 
    
    Jarreng is a village of almost 16,000 inhabitants in eastern The Gambia that needs a clean and consistently running water system. Having scoped the area, we have calculated the total cost of the project to be £52,000. 
    
    Breakdown of cost: 
    
    Taps (18)     - £20,000
    Borehole	    -	£5,000
    Piping		    -	£10,000
    Pump          -	£5,000
    Tank		      -	£5,000
    Solar Panels	-	£5,000
    Transport	    -	£2,000
    
    Sustainability:
    
    Each household in Jarreng will be given a fob (an electronic tag). These fobs can be taken to a shop in the village (this shop will be selected by the villagers) to be topped up with credit in exchange for Gambian Dalasi. Once it has credit, a fob can be used at the water systems smart taps to release water up to the value of credit on the fob. The cost of the water is equivalent to 1 p per litre. The funds we receive for the credit go towards maintaining the system.
